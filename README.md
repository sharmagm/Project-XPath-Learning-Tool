# XPath-Learning-Tool
This tool helps a user to learn about XPaths and XML. From any XML which is selected by a user, it dynamically generates majority of all the type of XPaths possible using Recursions and bind it to a combobox. 

When a user selects any XPath generated, he/she is provided with the resulting XML nodes corresponding to that XPath. 

In this way, a user gets to know about all the type of XPaths possible for any XML and also the resultant nodes of XPaths.
